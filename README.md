# Seminar on NFT
For the seminar I have choosen the NFT that is the Non Fumngible Token as my topic and presented it in the seminar.
The topic primarly deals with the NFT introduction, Background and the uses cases, applications, popularity, Marketplaces and security flaws and the properties that secure the NFTs and later improvements in it along with the future directions.

Here I attached the IEEE formatted PDF(with 0% plagarism) with the PPT(in PDF format).
